All right boy
Let me tell ya a story
It's about danny sanchez
and his time-travelling glory
It's the greatest game
that anyone'd known
all across the land
even in rome
everyone knew the game
because it was the best
it was the greatest game of all time
oh yes
He could go across the globe from cairo to madrid
everybody knows what that wonder kid did
It all began 
one bright and sunny day
Mr. schopf walked in
and he yelled 'hey'
Do you know what's up?
Do you know the deal?
Well you better sit on down cause here's the spiel
You got two days (two days?) yes two days
To the regional conference  - it's just two days away!
So you better hurry up
better get your stuff in line
better make it all look good
better turn it in on time
Danny said 'oh no'
and he started to panic
he started thinking crazy
and he started acting manic
And in that fit of uncontained anxiety
Danny lost his mind and he lost his propriety
Freaked out f-f-f-f-frikky-freaked out
Kicked his time machine by accident
that's what this song's about
Things went crazy they went catty-whompous
Time turned upside - upside down
All around
every town
from the zulu nation
to the cold war hatians
to the ancient greeks
to the sieks to the shieks
to the caliphates and romans
to the spartans, trojans, persians
even to the guests on conan
Time went WOAH
it got all distorted
Important inventions all got transported
Sopwith camels in macedonia
Computers in carthage; spartans in bolivia
That's the tale
that's where it began
chaos and time all scattered trought the land
So it sets our stage
for our game to begin
a shining protagonist
known henceforth as 'him'
or she
you see
we're not trying to be
sexist or anything
it's an inclusive environment
SO
This studious student
with the courage of a lion
is also sent back in time so he can try n'
fix everything
set histr'y back on course
it's no great mystery
it's a TSA discourse
What he has to do
is a fairly daunting task
travel throughout history
re-invent the past
be the suture 
for a promising tomorrow
in this tale of tragedy
there's no sorrow
This story we've told
it's simply a game
introducing inventors
showing you their names
The moral of this story
is a little more complex
It's not just about inventions
it's not meant to perplex
We're simply trying
to show the disutility
when you put TSA behind
agricultural responsibility!
